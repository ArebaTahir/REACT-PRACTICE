# Login and Signup Page

This project implements a login and signup page using React and Axios for handling API requests. The form allows users to toggle between login and signup modes, with input validation for password confirmation during signup.

## Features

- **Toggle between Login and Signup**: Users can easily switch between login and signup forms.
- **Validation**: Password confirmation during signup is validated to ensure both passwords match.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if an error occurs during form submission.
- **Axios for API Requests**: The form uses Axios to send API requests to the backend for authentication.
